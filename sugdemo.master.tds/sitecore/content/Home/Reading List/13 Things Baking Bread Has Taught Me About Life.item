Back in college, I worked in a bakery as part of paying for all of the fun and education I wanted to get out of those four years. To this day, a decade later, I still make my own bread to eat, give as gifts, and share with friends and coworkers whenever I can smuggle a fresh boule out of my own apartment. The hours I've spent baking bread have provided me with a lot of time to think about, well, everything. Rather than provide you with ten years of notes, here&rsquo;s a simple account of thirteen I things I learned.
